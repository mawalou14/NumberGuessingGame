# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This application is a simple yet fun game where the user thinks of a number, and the phone tries to guess it. The user provides hints, and the guesses are displayed on a scrollable list. Once the phone guesses the correct number, a summary screen is shown.

This app is a beginner's project and my first React Native project following a tutorial.
